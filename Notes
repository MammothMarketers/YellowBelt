# Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt Training - DMAIC

## Training Overview
The Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt training follows the DMAIC methodology, which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control.

## DMAIC Phases

### Define Phase - Clarify the Problem and Process

**Goal:** Create a Project Charter to clarify and focus the project.

#### Elements of a Project Charter:
1. **Project Title**
   - **Process Name**
   - **Measure Outcome**
   - **Direction of Improvement**
2. **Problem Statement**
3. **Business Case**
4. **Goal Statement**
5. **Timeline**
6. **Scope**
7. **Team Members**

#### Project Goal Statement
A Project Goal Statement is a precise, action-focused sentence stating what you plan to improve by how much and when.

#### Steps to Create a Project Title:
1. **Direction of Improvement**
2. **Process Name**
3. **Measure Outcome**

**Example:** Increase Claims Process Time

### Measure Phase - Quantify the Problem and Map the Process

**Goal:** Create a process map to visualize the process.

#### Process Map
A process map is a picture of the sequence of steps in a process.

1. Identify the process.
2. Gather input from people who work within the process.
3. Identify starting and ending points.
4. Map the process using symbols:
   - Terminator symbol for the first step
   - Rectangles for activities
   - Diamond symbols for decision points
5. Connect symbols with arrows to illustrate process flow.

#### Swimlane Map
A Swimlane Map separates processes into lanes representing different functions, departments, or individuals.

**Steps to Create a Swimlane Map:**
1. Understand the As-Is process.
2. Identify the different process groups.
3. Map the process within the lanes.

### Analyze Phase - Determine the Root Causes

**Goal:** Identify root causes of problems using tools like the 5 Whys and Cause & Effect diagrams.

#### 5 Whys Technique
A method to determine the root cause of a problem by asking "why" multiple times until the underlying issue is identified.

### Improve Phase - Confirm the Solutions Work

**Goal:** Implement solutions to eliminate or minimize issues causing problems.

#### Types of Improvements
1. **5S Methodology:**
   - **Sort:** Keep frequently used items, store less used items, remove unused items.
   - **Set in Order:** Arrange items for easy access.
   - **Shine:** Clean the work area.
   - **Standardize:** Develop consistent procedures.
   - **Sustain:** Periodic audits to maintain standards.
2. **Quick Win Solutions:**
   - Implement obvious, low-risk solutions quickly.

### Control Phase - Ensure the Gains are Sustained

**Goal:** Maintain improvements and prevent regression to old processes.

#### Control Methods
1. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Document detailed steps for consistent process execution.
2. **Visual Management:** Use visual cues to manage processes and ensure efficiency.

#### Examples of Visual Management:
- Display boards
- Maintenance schedules
- Status lights and signals

#### Project Handoff
1. Key actions to close the project
2. Summarize project results and controls
3. Document approval to close the project

## Tools and Concepts

### The 8 Wastes (DOWNTIME)
1. **Defects**
2. **Overproduction**
3. **Waiting**
4. **Non-Utilized Talent**
5. **Transportation**
6. **Inventory**
7. **Motion**
8. **Extra Processing**

### How to Identify Waste
1. **Process Maps**
2. **Gemba/Process Walks**
3. **Value Stream Mapping (VSM)**
4. **Value-Add Analysis**
5. **Engaging Employees**

### Process Walk Steps
1. **Pick Your Process**
2. **Create Your Process Map**
3. **Walk Your Process**
4. **Summarize Your Observations**
